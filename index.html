            A good coder writes for someone else, even for their future self. Their code is readable: proper indentation, horizontal more than vertical, 80 characters per line. "Indentation and spacing makes up 80% of your style."
            <h2><strong>80, 80</strong></h2>
            The truism goes: "When you are writing comments:
            <ul>
              <li>Beginners make comments about what they're doing</li>
              <li>More experienced people make comments on how they're doing what they're doing</li>
              <li>Experts make comments on why they're doing what they're doing"</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Write easy to understand variables</li>
              <li>Write very logical (flows into the next) structure</li>
              <li>Write comments about "this is how I do it" + "this is why I do it"</li>
              <li>Name their variables appropriately (ex. <span class="code">my_func</span> vs <span class="code">count_friends</span>)</li>
              <li>Validators exist for HTML &amp; CSS.</li>
              <li>D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself. "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." - Andy Hunt/Dave Thomas</li>
              <li>Avoid code bloat: Less code, less prone to code mistakes</li>
              <li>If one didn't have CSS classes, one would have had to style inline which would, not only make coding more difficult because it would be more granular, but it would also make debugging difficult. One should always code for others as well as your future self who will all maintain your code.</li>
              <li>If one didn't use an External style sheet for the CSS classes, one would have had to use an internal style sheet whose style would have only lived on that particular HTML file. Typically, it's reasonable to expect a given web project to consist of multiple HTML files, hence it's best practice to keep the whole project unified with similar style - similar style is guaranteed using an external style sheet. "Design changes happen in one place, rather than one hundred." - Chris Coyier</li>

              <li>Write easy to understand variables</li>
              <li>Write very logical (flows into the next) structure</li>
              <li>Write comments about "this is how I do it" + "this is why I do it"</li>
              <li>Name their variables appropriately (ex. <span class="code">my_func</span> vs <span class="code">count_friends</span>)</li>
              <li>Validators exist for HTML &amp; CSS.</li>
              <li>D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself. "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." - Andy Hunt/Dave Thomas</li>
              <li>Avoid code bloat: Less code, less prone to code mistakes</li>
              <li>If one didn't have CSS classes, one would have had to style inline which would, not only make coding more difficult because it would be more granular, but it would also make debugging difficult. One should always code for others as well as your future self who will all maintain your code.</li>
              <li>If one didn't use an External style sheet for the CSS classes, one would have had to use an internal style sheet whose style would have only lived on that particular HTML file. Typically, it's reasonable to expect a given web project to consist of multiple HTML files, hence it's best practice to keep the whole project unified with similar style - similar style is guaranteed using an external style sheet. "Design changes happen in one place, rather than one hundred." - Chris Coyier</li>
